# Dynamic_calculator
 For this laboratory we are going to build a static HTML page,  it should contain two inputs one for items names, the second one for price(a numeric value) and one button for adding the item into an un order list, each element inside the list should have a remove button which will remove the item from the list, at the bottom of the list should display the total of the items list  important points:  if an item is removed the total should be re calculated if the item name or the item values are empty it shouldn't add the item into the list if there are any invalid inputs mark the border of the container in red, if the input is correct we shouldn't paint anything
